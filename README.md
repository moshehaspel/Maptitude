Maptitude Add-Ins

Do you like Caliper's Maptitude software? Me too! And that's why I've built some plug-ins to make Maptitude even more useful. 

All of the plug-ins to be found here are free and open source, released under the GPLv3 license. 

If you find them useful, please consider making a donation to Neighborhood Nexus (https://neighborhoodnexus.org/), an Atlanta-based nonprofit devoted to increasing equity by democratizing access to community data, via this link: https://www.gagives.org/organization/Neighborhoodnexus
